## Setup Guide, step by step:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamedadi/FreeDjancer.git
```

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Install the Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create your database

#### Open your PostgreSQL shell with ```psql``` command
```bash
psql
```

#### Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

#### Create User
```sql
CREATE USER <username>;
```

#### Grant all privileges to FreeDjancer database user
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <username>;
```

#### Create a Password for your FreeDjancer database user
```sql
ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
```

### 5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your created config:
```python
SECRET_KEY='Your Secret Key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG='Status of debug of the project'
ALLOWED_HOSTS=''

DB_NAME='<database_name>'
DB_USER='<username>'
DB_PASSWORD='<password>'
DB_HOST='localhost'
DB_PORT=5432

EMAIL_HOST_USER='<your_email_host_user>'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='<your_email_host_password>'
```

### 6. Migrate tables to the database
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Troubleshooting:
If you see this error message:
```
django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: permission denied to create extension "citext"
HINT:  Must be superuser to create this extension.
```
Just enter this command to your database shell:
```sql
ALTER ROLE <username> SUPERUSER;
```

## New Features Added

1. **Chat System with WebSockets**
   - Real-time communication between users via WebSocket.
   - Each chat has a unique ID, and messages are stored and retrieved efficiently.

2. **User Profile and CV Management**
   - Endpoints for managing user profiles, CV details, skills, job experience, education, and certificates.
   
3. **JWT Authentication**
   - Secure user login and authentication using JWT tokens for API access.

### 7. Additional Notes:
- **Rate Limiting**: Weâ€™ve implemented rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/chats/`: Fetches all available chats.
  - `/api/messages/<chat_id>/`: Retrieves all messages in a specific chat.
  - `/api/users/`: Allows for user profile management.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
